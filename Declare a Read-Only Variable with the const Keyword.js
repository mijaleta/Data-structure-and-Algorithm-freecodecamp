// The keyword let is not the only new way to declare variables. In ES6, you can also declare variables using the const keyword.

// const has all the awesome features that let has, with the added bonus that variables declared using const are read-only. They are a constant value, which means that once a variable is assigned with const, it cannot be reassigned:

// const FAV_PET = "Cats";
// FAV_PET = "Dogs";
