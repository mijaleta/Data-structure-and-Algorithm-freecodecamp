// When you are defining a string you must start and end with a single or double quote. What happens when you need a literal quote: " or ' inside of your string?

// In JavaScript, you can escape a quote from considering it as an end of string quote by placing a backslash (\) in front of the quote.
const myStr = "I am a \"double quoted\" string inside \"double quotes\" "; // Change this line
